## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Stephanie

## About Me:
I live in Philadelphia, PA, but I am originally from New England. I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of New Hampshire in English and History. After growing up in Western Massachussetts, Southern Maine, and living in Southern New Hampshire during undergrad, I moved to Philadelphia and have been living in Philly fo the past 15 years. I worked in Clinical Data Management for about 11 years, managing data for cancer studies. I changed careers a few years back to persue my data and information interests in the english and history. I am a librarian at the Masonic Temple of Pennsylvania. I enjoy reading, spending time with my loved ones, and self-care.
  
## Fun fact: âš¡
If I could, I would be traveling and exploring all the time.
