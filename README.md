## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Stephanie

## About Me:
I live in Philadelphia, PA, but I am originally from New England. I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of New Hampshire in English and History. After growing up in Western Massachussetts, Southern Maine, and living in Southern New Hampshire during undergrad, I moved to Philadelphia and have been living in Philly fo the past 15 years. I worked in Clinical Data Management for about 11 years, managing data for cancer studies. I changed careers a few years back to persue my data and information interests in the english and history. I am a librarian at the Masonic Temple of Pennsylvania. I enjoy reading, spending time with my loved ones, and self-care.

If I could, I would be traveling and exploring all the time. 

## Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html)
### 1. Why do you find this dataset interesting?
I find the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) interesting because it's such a comprehensive resource that covers both historical and modern geographic names. It was collected to help catalog and describe cultural heritage objects with geographic connections, like art, architecture, and historical records. What makes it so useful is that it standardizes geographic names, which is helpful for researchers, catalogers, and curators when they're dealing with places with different names over time or in different languages. It's especially valuable for fields like art history, archaeology, and digital humanities because it can be used for things like geo-tagging or mapping cultural objects, making it easier to search and organize information.

### 2. What information is contained in the metadata of the dataset you selected? What additional information would be useful to include in the metadata?
 The TGN metadata contains important details such as:
- Place names (including alternate spellings, historical names, and variants)
- Coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Place type (city, river, desert, etc.)
- Hierarchical relationships (how the place fits within larger or smaller geographic areas)
- Historical notes (how the name or the place has changed over time)
- Cultural associations (connections to historical periods or civilizations)
   A couple of things that might be helpful to add would be more detailed info on modern administrative boundaries (like how these places fit within current political or governmental regions) and maybe a time-based layer that shows how names or boundaries have changed over history. Also, it would be nice to see more detailed citations or sources explaining where the info on historical names comes from.

### 3. How can the dataset be accessed? Are there any barriers to accessing the data?
The TGN dataset is accessible online through the Getty Vocabulary website, and you can download it in different formats like XML and JSON, which is helpful if you want to integrate it into other platforms. They also offer API access, so developers can use the data dynamically in their own applications. As for barriers, while the data is free for non-commercial use, you might need additional permissions if you want to use it for commercial purposes. Another potential challenge is that the structure of the dataset, especially in XML/JSON format, can be tricky to navigate if you're not familiar with those formats, so it might be a bit overwhelming for non-technical users.
